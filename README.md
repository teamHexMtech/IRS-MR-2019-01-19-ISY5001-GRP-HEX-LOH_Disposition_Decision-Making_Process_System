## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

The semiconductor backend testing is one of the most highly complex manufacturing systems in terms of equipment, process flows and interdependency relations. Furthermore, the complexity is increased due to a large product variety, complex product to tester relations, multiple level of tester to hardware dependency, sequence dependency, dynamic determination of processing and indexing time, batch processing and rework flow. Besides its complexity, the real production environment is also subjected to many uncertainties and unpredictable events due to continuous arrival of new and unforeseen orders and intermittent occurrence of machine breakdown, and random process and yield variations. Thus, the scheduling is no longer simply a static optimization problem, but an ongoing reactive process. Therefore, the scheduling operations and optimization in semiconductor backend testing are highly demanding and challenging for both researchers and practitioners.  

Based on the above considerations given to the different facets in the scheduling process, this project aims to introduce a real-time manufacturing scheduler that is capable of helping the production accomplish operation strategies, optimize goals and deal with daily disruptions such as machine breakdown and WIP discontinuity in a more effective way.
