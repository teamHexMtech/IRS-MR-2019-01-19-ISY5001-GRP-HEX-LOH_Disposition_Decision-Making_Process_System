## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

In the semiconductor manufacturing, the reliability and integrity of the integrated circuits (ICs) are especially critical to the automotive and aerospace industries whereby any premature failure will lead to catastrophic consequences. The test process is the last quality gate before the ICs are shipped to the customers, and thus it is most important process in the whole manufacturing chain to ensure that there are no defect being shipped out. 

Many companies place high emphasis on quality management and achieving ‘zero defect’. In quality management, the 6-sigma process control is widely used to improve quality and eliminate defects.  When the lot (batch of ICs) does not meet the quality and customer requirements, the process control will flag and stop the lot from proceeding on to the packing process and the lot will be on hold (LOH). The LOH will then be sent for further investigation to assess its risk and understand the cause of the deviation which may arise due to product or process-related problems.
